# Useful Py Scripts

A collection of Python scripts designed to simplify common tasks related to **coordinate conversion, PDF metadata extraction, and geological data processing**.

## üìú Scripts Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Convert DMS to DD (`convertcoordinates.py.py`)
- Converts **DMS coordinates** (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) in a CSV file to **Decimal Degrees (DD)**.
- Input: CSV file with `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns.
- Output: CSV file with converted coordinates in DD format.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract PDF Metadata (`pdf_metadata_extractor.py`)

- Designed for organizing **PDF book collections** by retrieving key details.
- Input: Folder containing PDFs.
- Output: CSV file with extracted metadata.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Georeferenced Data from PDFs (`pdfcoordpoints.py.py`)
- Parses a **PDF list of geological (or georeferenced) localities**, extracting relevant data.
- Extracts **coordinates, names, measurements, comments, and images**.
- Output: CSV file that can be converted into a **KMZ file** for mapping.
